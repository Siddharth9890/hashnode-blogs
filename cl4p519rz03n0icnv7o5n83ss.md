## Changes made in CS-Tracker and upgrade in tech-stack.

Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹.

In today's blog we are going to discuss all changes that we made in [cs-tracker](https://cs-tracker.vercel.app/) and why we choose typescript,redux,Next.js,Sql server as the tech stack. So let's begin.

Why did we choose to upgrade to typescript?
So the simple answer is to improve code readability and understanding how the code works and also to reduce lot's of bugs like undefined is passed during runtime such awesome features comes with a typed system only hence typescript is used over plain javascript.

Why did we choose to go with Next.js over react?
As we all know Next.js has a lot's of features like [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) to improve performance and seo as well main goal of Next.js is to generate HTML files which can improve performance as each and every browser runs/render HTML much faster than javascript.

Also all the images used in Next.js with [Next/Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) provides various image optimization features like image resizing converting jpg/png images to webp format and also reduces the size of image from megabytes to kilobytes.

Plus as a added bonus Next.js has in build page routing we don't need to add react-router as we do in react. It reduces code boilerplate and also allows more code segeration.

Why did we choose to go with Sql server over NoSql?
The only logical reason to move to sql server is that all  logical models used have more logical relation which can be elaborated and maintained in a sql server rather than using a noSql server and also main part to shift was to learn how to use node.js with sql server using a ORM like sequelize.

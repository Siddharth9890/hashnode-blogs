# So i heard about this 50 day challenge of javascript on codedamn website (not      sponsored by any way 😁). 

I tried doing this in fact i completed up to day 11 challenges but after that the challenges difficulty started increasing so i stopped doing it because i am not much familiar with javascript but the way challenges are designed seems nice for a quick revision of your javascript topics. 

Best way to revise such concepts using some day challenges as it keeps you engage with the community and you will learn something new every day that's what makes programming so fun😊. 

By the way if you want to check to to  [here's the link](https://codedamn.com/50-days-of-js) 

That's all for this blog see you in next one😊

Hello everyone

Today, we will discuss one of the most challenging tasks in working with a GraphQL server i.e creating an SDK. The pain often lies in writing .gql files and building corresponding TypeScript types to match the schema. Whenever the schema changes, we need to manually update the SDK, making the process tedious and error-prone, especially with frequent updates. These constant manual adjustments are not only a hassle but also open the door to potential mismatches between the schema and the types.

To solve this problem, I’ve created a tool called [graphql-sdk-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-sdk-generator)

This tool eliminates the problem by automating the generation of TypeScript code directly from the GraphQL schema. With graphql-sdk-generator, you no longer need to worry about manually updating types when the schema changes. The generator automatically produces the necessary code, ensuring that the TypeScript types are always up-to-date and accurately reflect the schema’s latest structure. This automation not only saves time but also removes the friction typically associated with manually maintaining SDKs.

Whenever the schema changes, simply re-run the generator, and the TypeScript code is updated effortlessly. This significantly improves development efficiency and streamlines SDK maintenance. While there are other tools on the market, such as [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) it comes with many dependencies and boilerplate code you might not need, and the SDK is closely tied to it. In contrast, graphql-sdk-generator gives you full control. Once the code is generated, you're free to modify it as needed, with only the graphql-request dependency required for making requests to your endpoint.

Check out the package on npm: [graphql-sdk-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-sdk-generator) Detailed documentation can be found here: [docs](https://docs.siddharth9890.com/graphql-sdk-generator).

Thank you for reading this post! I’d love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to ask any questions or share your feedback in the comments.
